# Personal Project 1
**Suggested Guidelines**
- 20 to 40 hours
- doesn't need to, and likely won't go on resume.

**Self-imposed Guidelines**
- learn pythonic way(s) to use existing libs
- try using the ['typing'](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) lib?
(((((((((((((((`)))))))))))))))    - it seems easy enough to implement, but I should look into it further.

**Text-based Adventure Game?**
- Python
- CLI
- look into established source-code to see about sensible structure?
- chat w/ Ben:
    - 'simulated terminal' to allow for some QoL options: auto-fill if going open text prompt route
    - should likely go with set list of things to choose
        - user chooses '[x] thing to interact with' from list, then 'thing to do with/on/to [x] item'
- need story/adventure ideas
